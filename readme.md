# Interesting and Educational Projects

This repository contains all of the interesting projects that I have come up with and will come up with in the future.
It contains interesting education competitions from Kaggle, an interesting project on generating easier
to visualize correlation plots, predicting customer churn and many different more in the future. 

# Better Correlation Plots and Heatmaps
I first came across this in an article by Drazen Zaric (https://towardsdatascience.com/better-heatmaps-and-correlation-matrix-plots-in-python-41445d0f2bec)
I thought that it was a really cool idea and that I could apply it in many of my projects.
My hope is to build on his work and see where that ends up.
